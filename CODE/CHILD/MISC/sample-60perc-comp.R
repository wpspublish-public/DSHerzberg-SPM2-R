# Comp demos between full sample and 60% sample
# Prepare table of demographics counts for the full sample. We first call map()
# to return a list of four dfs, with the case counts by age and category for
# each of the four demographic variables. We map over a vector holding the names
# of these four demo vars. The input to this mapping procedure is the full
# standardization sample. We group this input by age and the .x argument to
# map(), that is, the currently iterated demo var. We can then call summarize()
# to get the case counts (n()) for each category of the demo var, within each
# ageyear. At this point the summary table is in nested format, where the
# categories of the demo vars are nested with in each value of age, resulting in
# a long table. We call pivot_wider() to transform the table into a more
# conventional demographic table format, in which there is one row for each age
# year, each category of the demographic variable has its own column, and the
# cells contain the person counts for each crossing of age X demographic
# category.
